# Azure/Perks

This repository contains common reusable libraries and tools that has been accumulating in some node.js open source projects.  

Instead of having one project publish things tangentially to it's core mission, we're migrating that code here.

### Libraries 

#### polyfill
- library provides polyfill'd functions for typescript usage and common exception classes

#### console
Adds support to make consistent command line developer tools.
- uses `yargs` for command line parsing
- uses `markedTerminal` (and monkey-patches `console.*` functions to provide full console-rendered markdown support in tools)

#### async-io
- async wrappers for common IO functionality

#### unpack
- targz/zip file unpacking from stream

#### eventing 
- nice eventing framework with subscribe/unsubscribe that's TS friendly
